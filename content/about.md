about_body: >-
  I am a freelance software developer, specialising in **Javascript** and
  **React** applications. I also have experience working with **PHP**, **Go**,
  **Python**, **Java** and **C#**.


  With these languages, I make websites, web apps, mobile apps and other software solutions.  I also enjoy creating learning content for other developers.


  I'm English, but live in the Canary Islands.  When I am not in front of a computer, you'll often find me helping out at my local dog rescue shelter.
